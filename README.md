## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, FastMCP
- **ML Framework**: LightGBM, scikit-learn
- **AI Integration**: Grok AI API
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Authentication**: Bearer Token with RSA encryption
- **Deployment**: Async server with ngrok tunneling

---

## üìä Dataset
**Ebbu2017 Phishing Dataset**
- **Source**: https://github.com/ebubekirbbr/pdd/tree/master/input
- **Legitimate URLs**: 36,400 samples
- **Phishing URLs**: 37,175 samples
- **Total**: 73,575 URLs for training

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
```python
# Combined legitimate and phishing datasets
# Created binary labels (0 = legitimate, 1 = phishing)
# Saved as unified CSV format
```

**Key Actions:**
- Loaded JSON datasets for legitimate and phishing URLs
- Added binary classification labels
- Combined datasets into single training file
- Ensured data quality and consistency

### Step 2: Feature Engineering
We implemented a hybrid approach combining:

**Statistical Features (10 features):**
- URL length and hostname length
- Path length and subdirectory count
- Number of digits and special characters
- IP address detection
- HTTPS usage
- Query parameter count
- Suspicious keyword detection

**TF-IDF Features (3000 features):**
- Character-level n-grams (3-5 chars)
- Captures URL patterns and structures
- Handles obfuscation techniques

### Step 3: Model Training
**LightGBM Classifier Configuration:**
- 300 estimators for robust learning
- Learning rate: 0.05 for stability
- Unlimited depth for complex patterns
- Cross-validation with 80-20 split

**Performance Metrics:**
- High accuracy on test set
- Balanced precision and recall
- Fast inference time for real-time detection

### Step 4: MCP Server Architecture
**Core Components:**
1. **Authentication System**: Secure bearer token validation
2. **Model Loading**: Pickle-based model persistence
3. **Dual Scoring**: ML + Grok AI hybrid approach
4. **Statistics Tracking**: User and global analytics
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management

### Step 5: API Design
**Main Tools/Endpoints:**

1. **`validate()`**: Server validation for Puch AI
2. **`analyze_url()`**: Single URL phishing analysis
3. **`batch_analyze_urls()`**: Bulk analysis (up to 10 URLs)
4. **`get_user_stats()`**: User analytics and history

### Step 6: Hybrid Scoring System
**Lambda-weighted Combination:**
- Default Œª = 0.6 (60% Grok AI, 40% ML model)
- Customizable weighting per request
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Confidence level classification

### Step 7: Real-time Processing
**Optimization Features:**
- Async request handling
- Processing time tracking
- Memory-efficient model loading
- Batch processing capabilities

### Step 8: User Experience
**Response Format:**
- Clear phishing/safe classification
- Risk levels (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Confidence indicators
- Detailed technical analysis
- User-friendly summaries with emojis

### Step 9: Security & Monitoring
**Security Measures:**
- Token-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Comprehensive logging

**Analytics:**
- Per-user request tracking
- Global phishing detection rates
- Error monitoring
- Server uptime statistics

### Step 10: Deployment & Scaling
**Production Setup:**
- HTTP server on port 8086
- Ngrok tunneling for public access
- Docker-ready configuration
- Environment variable management
